          My name is Samuel Brian, and I am a Fullstack Software Engineer with
          substantial expertise in front-end and back-end development. I
          specialize in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and
          visually appealing web applications. My focus is on designing
          user-friendly interfaces that not only capture attention but also
          provide a seamless user experience through simplicity and
          interactivity. In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to
          staying updated with the latest web development trends and best
          practices. My passion for technology extends beyond programming; I
          also enjoy engaging with video editing and creating gaming content.
          These hobbies allow me to explore my creativity while enhancing my
          technical abilities.
